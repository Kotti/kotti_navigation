Changelog
=========

0.5 (2016-02-26)
----------------

* Use kotti_settings for configuration of the navigation widget.

  The previously used configuration in the ini file is not supported
  anymore. The configuration is now done via the settings interface
  where you can adjust the navigation widget to your needs at run time.


0.4a2 (2013-04-18)
------------------

* Clarified descriptions and improved wording in the readme. [geojeff]


0.4a1 (2013-04-18)
------------------

* Warning: the changes for this release do wholesale renaming, so existing
  deployments will require adjustment.
* Moved to a configuration approach that allows multiple navigation displays,
  in different locations, where the new concept of location encompasses both
  slots and the top, which is the area of Kotti's default navbar. [geojeff]
* Added an include_content_types param, as a counterpart to the existing
  exclude_content_types. This way a display type can be set to only include
  specific content types, as with an images-only display. [geojeff]
* Devised new display type names that are more specific and descriptive, and
  are representative of the options available with Bootstrap. [geojeff]
* Changed the handling of the top location to remove the default Kotti nav
  altogether, and replace it with optional specific placement of the menu
  display type, restricted to the area between brand and search in the Kotti
  navbar, and allowing any display type underneath the navbar. [geojeff]
* Added a breadcrumbs display type that is the same as the default Kotti one,
  but with a configurable label. [geojeff]
* Added a treatment for the menu display type for root, so that it is always
  shown (previously, the menu simply did not show for root). [geojeff]


0.3 (2013-04-17)
----------------

0.3a1 (2012-12-04)
