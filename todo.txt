   - Add CSS settings for the left margin of the menu dropdown, which has no
     margin in some cases.

   - Add CSS styling for the nav-header used for the label. Perhaps it could
     be centered vertically.

   - Should other locations be made available?

   - How does the multi-location configuration compare to what is planned for
     kotti_panels? Does the design of one impact the other?

   - If angular.js were to be included with kotti_navigation, a new style of
     navigation could be opened up. Possibilities here include the addition of
     a responsive collapsible tree display, an accordion display, etc.
