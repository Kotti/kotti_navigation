   - Add CSS settings for the left margin of the menu dropdown, which has no
     margin in some cases.

     -----
     2013/04/08 -- tried adding this to CSS but the first item "Site" is not
     affected:

     #navigation-menu .nav li + .nav-header { margin-left: 0px; }

     Perhaps a structual fix in layout, with another class set, or a wrapping
     div is needed. 

     NOTE: The bootstrap CSS for nav-header li items is margin-left: -15px.
     -----

   - Add CSS styling for the nav-header used for the label. Perhaps it could
     be centered vertically.

   - Should other locations be made available? Should the top location be
     split into two: top_in_navbar (between brand and search) and
     top_below_navbar?

   - For abovecontent, belowcontent, beforebodyend, top_below_navbar (if 
     separate location), which are full-width, have align_left, align_center,
     align_right?

   - How does the multi-location configuration compare to what is planned for
     kotti_panels? Does the design of one impact the other?

   - Pull needed code from scripts of kotti_user_manual to build a screen
     capture utility. Run a script that sets config for different widget uses
     and combinations, calling populate() as needed to add needed content
     before taking the screen captures. This can double as documentation and
     showcase, as well as a way to do visual testing.
     
   - If angular.js were to be included with kotti_navigation, a new style of
     navigation could be opened up. Possibilities here include the addition of
     a responsive collapsible tree display, an accordion display, etc.
